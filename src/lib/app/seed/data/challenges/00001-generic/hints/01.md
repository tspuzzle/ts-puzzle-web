A generic type in TypeScript can be thought of as a JavaScript function with parameters, but instead of working with values (variables), it works with types.

For example. we may define some interface for storage that should manipulate with diffrent type items:
```ts
interface Storage<T> {
    item: T;
    get: () => T;
    put: (item: T) => T;
}
```
Therefore `Storage` for `number` will be defined as `Storage<number>`
