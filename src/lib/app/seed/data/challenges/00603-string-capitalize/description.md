Implement the built-in `Capitalize<T>` generic without using it which converts the first letter of a string to uppercase and leave the rest as-is. 

**Note:**
You could not use built-in type utilities such as `Capitalize` and `Uppercase`

For example:
  ```ts
MyCapitalize<'hello world'> // expected to be 'Hello world'
  ```
