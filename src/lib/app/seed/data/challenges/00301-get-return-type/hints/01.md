Whenever you need to extract a specific part of a type, you typically use conditional types in combination with type inference.

For example, if you want to create a type that extracts the type of a particular object field (for example, for field `name`), you could do it like this:

```ts
type ExtractNamePropertyType<T> = 
    T extends { name: infer PropertyType } ? PropertyType : never;

ExtractNamePropertyType<{name: 'Bob'}> // expected Bob
ExtractNamePropertyType<{field: 'Bob'}> // expected never
```
Here you:
- defined the expected type shape in condition type - in this case the type shape is
an object that contains field `name`
- inferred the part of type that you are interested in with keyword `infer` - in this case we are interested in a type for the field `name`. Therefore `infer PropertyType`
extract targeted field type in a type `PropertyType` that may be used aftewards.
